### About me

A Veteran of the US Army, serving the majority of my military career in Kitzingen Germany as part of the 3RD Infantry Division.

Since my military service, I have done many different types of work, but have always had Programming as a serious hobby since 1993. Starting off with MS Basic, Assembly(briefly), then onto C. Prefering to write code that runs on Linux, in C, whenever possible, I am flexible enough to use whichever programming language, and technology that is best suited for the job.

Current interests as partially stated in my BIO do include Web technologies such as Javascript, NodeJS, and REACT. Having a keen interest in backend technologies, I feel as though web technologies since web 1.0 have become very interesting, and indeed equally complex.

In addition to the programming languages mentioned in my Bio, I have hands on with C++, VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Golang, Python, HTML, and CSS.

As for technologies, I find Blockchain, WEB 3.0, Machine learning, and CI/CD Pipelines, and / or DevOps the most interesting.
